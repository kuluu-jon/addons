# autofps
are you tired of having to toggle `/fps 2` when in cities or intense battles?
are you also tired of toggling `fps 1` back on when you're in a calmer area?
autofps checks for FPS dips and will adjust your maximum FPS to improve responsiveness and stability.

## usage
in-game, or in your boot script:
`/addon load autofps`
`/autofps` -- toggles the settings UI.
